Additionally, you cannot reload older save files in Honour mode if events go awry - your choices and their consequences are permanent. If your entire party is defeated in combat, your Honour mode run will end in failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are victorious and beat Home Brew on Honour mode, your accomplishment will be listed in game for all other players players to see! Upon having done so, reach out to the mod author (HaVeNII7) with proof to be included.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck, adventurer. You're really going to need it.</content>
