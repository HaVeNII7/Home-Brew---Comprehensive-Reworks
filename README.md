First off, I want to start by saying thank you for taking interest in my mod. This is my first actual mod, and while it started as a small project, it very quickly grew into something substantially larger than what I had ever intended. There were hundreds of late hours of play testing, and hundreds more fixing bugs. At this point, I'm over a thousand hours into development of the project. My goal is to provide an expansion of content and mechanics in such a way that it feels professional, well balanced, and like it belongs.  
  
Reading about others who have enjoyed this project has incredible. So again, thank you for taking interest. I hope you enjoy it, too.

## Description:
Home Brew reworks all of Baldurs Gate 3. All classes, subclasses, feats, equipment and gear, Spells, NPCs, and so much more.  
There are hundreds of new passive and status effects to come across, hundreds of new builds and dozens of new playstyles.  
All changes apply to creatures and NPCs, who now also have subclasses.  
  
It was my goal to provide in this overhaul a sense of professionalism and quality that makes the mod feel as though it could belong in the base game. To accomplish this, well over a thousand hours have been put into quality assessment and bug fixes. Thousands of lines of text have been rewritten to properly explain new effects and mechanics, all of which include interactive tooltips so that the player is never confused while playing.  
  
In addition to this, as mentioned above, this is a community project. On our Discord, changes are constantly discussed among the community to find the best solutions and ideas to expand build variety, fix problems, and more.

## Installation:  
Installation is simple, and just two files. The main file will need to be installed like any other .PAK, with your preferred mod manager. The second file is a loose file which enables thousands of Home Brew's text edits. It can be installed like any other mod if using Vortex, otherwise you will need to simply place it within your game installs "Data" folder. Let me know if you need any assistance installing this. We also have a myriad of optional files which can adjust difficulty and other parameters.  
  
**If you are skilled when it comes to CRPGs, I strongly encourage you to start with the following difficulty addon files:  
"Impaired Extra Attack"  
"Increased Enemy Health"  
"Increased Enemy Stats"**

**The "Harder Bosses" and "Slower Level Curve" addons can make Home Brew significantly harder.  
Use these if you want a truly challenging experience.
Home Brew is balanced with these recommended difficulty addons in mind.**  
  
## Documentation:  
  
All documentation can be found within our Discord, documented in great detail by users within our community.  
This documentation has been an ongoing project and as of now, is a resource totaling over 200 pages.  
Check out the link below in order to view these detailed changes for yourself.  
  
**[Click Here to View the Full Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-URJyBh-IDHQ27XyQ9Gu_jG2aEQip-vMjTS5QjLCk8/edit?tab=t.0)**
  
These documents are updated alongside the mod in order to reflect the latest additions, balance changes, reworks, etc.   
  
## Compatibility: 
  
This is an absolutely massive mod, which makes thousands of edits. If you are utilizing any other mod which edits classes, such as when a class unlocks something, class features, or class buffs/nerfs, there is a good chance that there will be some sort of compatibility issue.  
  
If you want another mod to take precedence over my own, simply load it after. Any changes that I have made can, to my knowledge, be safely overwritten by another mod (safe meaning, to not cause a crash). That said, mixing together mods which handle the same types of systems can get messy pretty fast, so use multiple at your own discretion.  
  
As far as making compatibility patches, I am more than happy to provide patches provided they are relatively quick to do, so this will vary on a case by case basis. Should you wish to add additional modded subclasses to this overhaul, I have provided both an in depth written guide as an optional download, and a video pinned in the comments section which you can use to follow along to the guide, step by step. It takes around 20-30 minutes to learn how to add a modded subclass with these guides, and then doing so can take as little as 5 minutes once you've got the process down. That said, please do reach out to me if you require help! I'm more than happy to provide assistanace.  
  
The more people who learn to mod this game, the better! Maintaining and updating this mod alone is quite a lot of work, which I need to balance with my personal life. So if I don't get back to you quickly, please do be patient. I tend to try and get back with someone no more than 24 hours after they have left a comment.  
  
And I want to put this out there as a blanket statement as well - all of my mods are open use permissions, forever, no questions asked.  
If you know how to make the edit and want to upload it, go for it! In my opinion, that’s what modding is all about.  
  
**Thank you for your time.**
